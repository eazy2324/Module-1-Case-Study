Recommendations
If I were an advisor for Fidelity I would suggest they focus more on the innovation of AI technology within their website services and data analysis. They should also look into more robo-advisors to help better understand and analyze the client financials and risk tolerance in order to provide personalized investment advice and portfolio. The increased use of robo-advisors will allow a larger customer base along with reduced cost related to human advisors.
 	A core challenge with robo-advisors is building the customers trusts which is not easy to do in this climate with the amount of fraudulent scheme used within modern technology. Also insuring the fluidity of the robot since most people prefer human advisors a lot of the time people run into minor communication issues. Robo-advisors can be marketed towards a young more technologically advanced demographic also being a more affordable investment advice. Also provides hands off investing for and detailed help for smaller portfolios.
 Fidelity would need to invest more into AI and machine learning as well a crash courses to show customers how to use the new services. Use of robo-advisors provides fidelity with the potential to further its customer service allowing them to reach more clients.
